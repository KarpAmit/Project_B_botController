1. Run the code - robot_main.py
2. After running the code, a grid with empty white cells will appear.
3. You can select cells and click the left mouse button. The first click will mark the robot's starting point, and the next click will mark its endpoint. By repeating this process, multiple robots will appear.
4. To designate walls, use the scroll wheel, and then mark cells with the left mouse button.
5. Now, on the board, you have multiple robots with a starting point, an endpoint, and walls. Press the space key to see the optimal path from the start to the endpoint for each robot, considering only distance and walls.
6. Once each robot's path is displayed, you can run a simulation. Start by pressing the G key, which will erase the marked paths, and each robot will move forward by one step. Each press of the G key will move all robots   that haven't yet reached their destination one step forward.
7. During the simulation, you can press the R key to display the radius within which each robot searches for other robots.
8. At the end of the run – once all robots have reached their destinations – the run will complete, and the window will close.
